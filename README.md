DESCRIPTION

The data was collected from European Centre for Prevention and Control. It contained 27704 rows and 7 columns.

I processed and cleaned the data in the jupyter notebook. I used the programming language, Python. I used R to

visualize the data. I created line graphs, bar graphs, heatmaps and timeline plots. I saved as .png files.

I have posted those pictures on my Instagram account: nan.viz.
